This module includes old-school map symbols meant to be used as tiles. They are organized and tagged using the Baileywiki Mass Edit module, but are usable without it as regular tiles. All images are webp files sized 100 px per square.

There is also a series of svg images meant to be used for map pins. Numbers 1-99 and letters a-z are included. They are in old-school-map-symbols\artwork\svg

Thank you!
